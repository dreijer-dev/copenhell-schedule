# Copenhell Schedule 2025

A web application for displaying the Copenhell festival schedule in an interactive timeline format.

The Copenhell website does not provide a schedule overview; instead, it only lists all events. This means that users must open each event individually to see when and at which stage the event is at.
Their app has a schedule (üôè), but I was missing the timeline overview ‚Äî- and that's why this app was quickly made.

Works on desktop and mobile and has a vertical line for the current time on the day of the festival.

My buddy Weidick scraped the data from the Copenhell website.
